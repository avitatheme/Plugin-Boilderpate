Settings store all variables, config switches, etc.
Split up into logical sections, the smaller and simpler the better.

/*
Tools store all programic Sass functionality.
If your tooling is simplistic enough, you can do something like:
  tools.mixins
If your tooling is more complex you can split it up like:
  tools.grid
  tools.typography
  etc.

Generic rules are project-agnostic.
These can be copied from any project to the next

/*
Components are the stuff of UI. Eg. buttons, special titles, etc.
These get much more explicitly named: eg. products-list, etc.
